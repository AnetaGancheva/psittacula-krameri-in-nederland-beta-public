# A rewrite of an earlier project done in ReactJS into vanilla JS

## Original project info

Ongoing project in ReactJS that will be hosted on own hosting machine with all necessary security functionalities.

## This project 

This project will serve as a beta version of the self-hosted project. 

It will be easier to show to others, get feedback, convey UI/UX ideas and implement changes. Will also serve as a practice to use vanilla JS to attain the same functionality. Not meant to be hosted or distributed. Will not have the exact same code and front/back-end capabilities as original.
